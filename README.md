Android Custom Toggle Buttons,TextView
=============================

[Visit the GISi Blog](http://gisinc.com/talk/creating-reusable-custom-toggle-button-android-applications/) for a tutorial covering the code in this repo

togglebutton 有切换动画效果, textview 有类似支付宝数字变化效果

The toggle button will consist of a black oval containing a circle. The circle's position represents the current setting: left for "off", right for "on". When the toggle button is pressed, the circle will move to the right and the containing oval will animate to green.

BONUS: this control is directly tied to Android's SharedPreferences, so your setting will persist to the device
